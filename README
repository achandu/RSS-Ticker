Phase III has been completed.  Feeds now stream in a random order across
the ticker.  Also, clicking one will immediately remove it from the list
of possible links to scroll across.  The ticker now refreshes its feeds
during whatever time period is set.  The one piece of promised
functionality that has not been delivered is the ability to make links
expire.  However, this is partially alleviated by having the list of
possible links reset everytime the ticker is updated.  The ticker may 
now be launched with or without the options menu, depending on user
settings.  Also, right clicking on the ticker will open the options
menu if it is not already open.  The bug with the ticker not restarting
after the mouse has been moved off of it seems to have been fixed.
Text color has been changed from (0,0,255) to (8,232,222) in order to
improve readability.  Finally, the text no longer leaves a trail on the
ticker as items scroll by.

Phase II has been completed.  Feeds now stream links across the ticker,
 and the links will open upon being clicked.  The feeds do not look
 particularly nice yet, but that is for phase IV.  Phase III will see
 the options frame made optional, as well as randomly presenting links
 and giving them a time limit upon which they may expire.

Phase I has been completed.  A moving ticker and an options menu have been implemented.
RSS feeds have not yet been implemented, and options do not save between sessions.

No code has been added to this repository yet, it will be added as each
phase of production occurs.  The goal of this project is to write a desktop
RSS reader which displays feeds as a News Ticker, such as the ones seen on
the bottom of the screen on news networks such as CNN, Fox, and MSNBC.
