Phase I has been completed.  A moving ticker and an options menu have been implemented.
RSS feeds have not yet been implemented, and options do not save between sessions.

No code has been added to this repository yet, it will be added as each
phase of production occurs.  The goal of this project is to write a desktop
RSS reader which displays feeds as a News Ticker, such as the ones seen on
the bottom of the screen on news networks such as CNN, Fox, and MSNBC.
