Phase II has been completed.  Feeds now stream links across the ticker,
 and the links will open upon being clicked.  The feeds do not look
 particularly nice yet, but that is for phase IV.  Phase III will see
 the options frame made optional, as well as randomly presenting links
 and giving them a time limit upon which they may expire.

Phase I has been completed.  A moving ticker and an options menu have been implemented.
RSS feeds have not yet been implemented, and options do not save between sessions.

No code has been added to this repository yet, it will be added as each
phase of production occurs.  The goal of this project is to write a desktop
RSS reader which displays feeds as a News Ticker, such as the ones seen on
the bottom of the screen on news networks such as CNN, Fox, and MSNBC.
